\section{Personalized Schedules for Repeat Biopsies}
\label{sec : pers_sched_approaches}
We intend to use the joint model fitted to $\mathcal{D}_n$, to create personalized schedules of biopsies. To this end, let us assume that a schedule is to be created for a new patient $j$, who is not present in $\mathcal{D}_n$. Let $t$ be the time of his latest biopsy, and $\mathcal{Y}_j(s)$ denote his historical PSA measurements up to time $s$. The goal is to find the optimal time $u > \mbox{max}(t,s)$ of the next biopsy.

\subsection{Algorithm}
\label{subsec : pers_sched_algorithm}
When a biopsy gets scheduled at a time $u < T^*_j$, then GR is not detected at $u$ and at least one more biopsy is required at an optimal time $u^{new} > \mbox{max}(u,s)$. This process is repeated until GR is detected. To aid in medical decision making, we elucidate this process via an algorithm in Figure \ref{fig : sched_algorithm}. AS programs strongly advise that two biopsies have a gap of at least one year. Thus, when $u - t < 1$, the algorithm postpones $u$ to $t + 1$, because it is the time nearest to $u$, at which the one-year gap condition is satisfied.
