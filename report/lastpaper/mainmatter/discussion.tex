Put your final comments here. 
Key points:

1. heuristic schedules are burdensome
2. they do not account for cohort to cohort variation
3. doctors want to utilize information
4. new MRI is coming up....biopsies are still needed though
5. we need to combine information and use it rather than use single items such as flowchart
6. decisions need to be more informative: 
7. refer to what we did earlier

Metholodology key points:
1. simple rule is threshold based biopsy
2. how to choose that threshold
3. minimize squared distance
4. constrain time delay to one year
5. or just go by threshold: do not take too much risk
6. or stick to a fixed threshold
7. interpret each threshold by the two pieces of information
8. issues with cutoff choice methods

Figure (all should be clear in black and white and in color):
1. figure of delay explanation
2. figure of dynamic risk
3. figure of scheduling biopsies
4. figure of biopsy schedule in demo patient
5. figure of distance explaining what we did
6. simulation results boxplot
