\opening{Dear Professor Goetghebeur,}

We are writing to you with respect to the manuscript \#SIM-21-0304, titled ``Shared Decision Making of Burdensome Surveillance Tests Using Personalized Schedules and Their Burden and Benefit'' submitted to \emph{Statistics in Medicine} and the reports we received after its review. We would like to thank you for giving us the opportunity to submit a revised version of our paper that tackles the weaknesses of the previous version.

Following the recommendations from the Reviewers, we have made changes in the revised version of the manuscript. In particular, we have added explanations for the model equations to make them accessible to a wider audience. We have also discussed the impact of the increasing use of MRI on the findings reported in our paper. The ``clean'' version of the manuscript is titled ``main\_manuscript.pdf'', the manuscript with highlighted changes is titled ``edited\_manuscript.pdf'', and the appendices are compiled into a file titled ``supplementary.pdf''.

Please find enclosed a detailed point-by-point response to the Reviewers' comments.\\

Yours sincerely,

the Authors
