\opening{Dear Professor Schwartz,}

We are writing to you with respect to the manuscript \#MDM-19-037, titled ``Personalized Decision Making for Biopsies in Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Programs'' submitted to \emph{Medical Decision Making} and the reports we received after its review. We would like to thank you for giving us the opportunity to submit a revised version of our paper that tackles the weaknesses of the previous version.

Following the recommendations from the Reviewers, we have made changes in the revised version of the manuscript. In particular, we have added description for the model equations in the Methods section. We have also discussed the impact of increasing use of MRI on the findings reported in our paper.

Please find enclosed a detailed point-by-point response to the Reviewers' comments.\\

Yours sincerely,

the Authors
