\begin{abstract}
\textbf{Background.} Low-risk prostate cancer patients enrolled in active surveillance (AS) programs commonly undergo biopsies for examination of cancer progression. AS programs employ a fixed schedule of biopsies (e.g. annual biopsies) for all patients. Such fixed and frequent schedules may schedule unnecessary biopsies. Since biopsies are burdensome, patients do not always comply with the schedule, which increases the risk of delayed detection of cancer progression. \textbf{Objective.} Motivated by the world's largest AS program, Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS), our aim is to counter the aforementioned problems by personalizing the decision of conducting biopsies during follow-up visits. \textbf{Methods.} Using joint models for time-to-event and longitudinal data, during each follow-up visit we first jointly model the historical prostate-specific antigen levels, digital rectal examination, and repeat biopsy results of a patient. This results in a patient-specific posterior predictive distribution of the time of cancer progression. We then use the latter under the general framework of Bayesian decision theory to personalize the decision of conducting biopsy at the follow-up visit. Lastly, we conduct a simulation study to compare the fixed schedules (annual and PRIAS schedules) with the proposed personalized approach. \textbf{Results.} In comparison to the fixed schedules, the personalized approach saves seven biopsies per patient on average among the slowly progressing patients. For faster progressing patients, the personalized approach saves one biopsy. Despite this reduction in the number of biopsies, the delay in the detection of cancer progression for the personalized approach is still comparable with that of the PRIAS schedule. \textbf{Conclusions.} We conclude that personalized schedules better balance the number of biopsies per detected cancer progression.
