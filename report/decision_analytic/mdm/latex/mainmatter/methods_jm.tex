\subsection{A Bivariate Joint Model for the Longitudinal PSA, and DRE Measurements, and Time of Cancer Progression}
Let $T_i^*$ denote the true cancer progression time of the ${i\mbox{-th}}$ patient included in PRIAS. Since biopsies are conducted periodically, $T_i^*$ is observed with interval censoring ${l_i < T_i^* \leq r_i}$. When progression is observed for the patient at his latest biopsy time $r_i$, then $l_i$ denotes the time of the second latest biopsy. Otherwise, $l_i$ denotes the time of the latest biopsy and ${r_i=\infty}$. Let $\boldsymbol{y}_{di}$ and $\boldsymbol{y}_{pi}$ denote his observed DRE and PSA longitudinal measurements, respectively. The observed data of all $n$ patients is denoted by ${\mathcal{D}_n = \{l_i, r_i, \boldsymbol{y}_{di}, \boldsymbol{y}_{pi}; i = 1, \ldots, n\}}$.

\caption{\textbf{Illustration of the joint model fitted to the PRIAS dataset}. \textbf{Panel~A:} shows the observed DRE measurements and the fitted probability of obtaining $\mbox{DRE} > \mbox{T1c}$ (Equation~\ref{eq:long_model_dre}) for $i$-th patient. \textbf{Panel~B:} shows the observed and fitted $\log_2(\mbox{PSA} + 1)$ measurements (Equation~\ref{eq:long_model_psa}). \textbf{Panel~C:} shows the estimated $\log_2(\mbox{PSA} + 1)$ velocity (velocity cannot be observed directly) over time. The hazard function (Equation~\ref{eq:rel_risk_model}) shown in \textbf{Panel~D}, depends on the fitted log odds of having a $\mbox{DRE} > \mbox{T1c}$, and the fitted $\log_2(\mbox{PSA} + 1)$ value and velocity.}

In our joint model, the patient-specific DRE and PSA measurements over time are modeled using a bivariate generalized linear mixed effects sub-model. The sub-model for DRE is given by (see~Panel~A, Figure~\ref{fig:jmExplanationPlot_1757}):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:long_model_dre}
\begin{split}
    \mbox{logit} \big[\mbox{Pr}\{y_{di}(t) > \mbox{T1c}\}\big] &= \beta_{0d} + b_{0di} + (\beta_{1d} + b_{1di}) t\\
    &+ \beta_{2d} (\mbox{Age}_i-70) + \beta_{3d} (\mbox{Age}_i-70)^2
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
where, $t$ denotes the follow-up visit time, and $\mbox{Age}_i$ is the age of the ${i\mbox{-th}}$ patient at the time of inclusion in AS. The fixed effect parameters are denoted by ${\{\beta_{0d}, \ldots, \beta_{3d}\}}$, and ${\{b_{0di}, b_{1di}\}}$ are the patient specific random effects. With this definition, we assume that the patient-specific log odds of obtaining a DRE measurement larger than T1c remain linear over time. 

The mixed effects sub-model for PSA is given by (see~Panel~B, Figure~\ref{fig:jmExplanationPlot_1757}):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:long_model_psa}
\begin{split}
    \log_2 \big\{y_{pi}(t) + 1\big\} &= m_{pi}(t) + \varepsilon_{pi}(t),\\
    m_{pi}(t) &= \beta_{0p} + b_{0pi} + \sum_{k=1}^4 (\beta_{kp} + b_{kpi})  B_k(t,\mathcal{K})\\ 
    &+ \beta_{5p} (\mbox{Age}_i-70) + \beta_{6p} (\mbox{Age}_i-70)^2,
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
where, $m_{pi}(t)$ denotes the underlying measurement error free value of $\log_2 (\mbox{PSA} + 1)$ transformed \citep{pearson1994mixed,lin2000latent} measurements at time $t$. We model it non-linearly over time using B-splines \citep{de1978practical}. To this end, our B-spline basis function $B_k(t, \mathcal{K})$ has 3 internal knots at $\mathcal{K} = \{0.1, 0.7, 4\}$ years, and boundary knots at 0 and 5.42 years (95-th percentile of the observed follow-up times). The fixed effect parameters are denoted by ${\{\beta_{0p},\ldots,\beta_{6p}\}}$, and ${\{b_{0pi}, \ldots, b_{4pi}\}}$ are the patient specific random effects. The error $\varepsilon_{pi}(t)$ is assumed to be t-distributed with three degrees of freedom (see~Appendix~B.1) and scale $\sigma$, and is independent of the random effects. 

To account for the correlation between the DRE and PSA measurements of a patient, we link their corresponding random effects. More specifically, the complete vector of random effects ${\boldsymbol{b}_i = (b_{0di}, b_{1di}, b_{0pi}, \ldots, b_{4pi})^T}$ is assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution with mean zero and variance-covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{D}$.

To model the impact of DRE and PSA measurements on the risk of cancer progression, our joint model uses a relative risk sub-model. More specifically, the hazard of cancer progression $h_i(t)$ at a time $t$ is given by (see~Panel~D, Figure~\ref{fig:jmExplanationPlot_1757}):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rel_risk_model}
\begin{split}
    h_i(t) &= h_0(t) \exp\Big(\gamma_1 (\mbox{Age}_i-70) + \gamma_2 (\mbox{Age}_i-70)^2\\
    &+\alpha_{1d} \mbox{logit} \big[\mbox{Pr}\{y_{di}(t) > \mbox{T1c}\}\big]+ \alpha_{1p} m_{pi}(t) + \alpha_{2p} \frac{\partial m_{pi}(t)}{\partial {t}}\Big),
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
where, $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$ are the parameters for the effect of age. The parameter $\alpha_{1d}$ models the impact of log odds of obtaining a $\mbox{DRE} > \mbox{T1c}$ on the hazard of cancer progression. The impact of PSA on the hazard of cancer progression is modeled in two ways: a) the impact of the error free underlying PSA value $m_{pi}(t)$ (see~Panel~B, Figure~\ref{fig:jmExplanationPlot_1757}), and b) the impact of the underlying PSA velocity $\partial m_{pi}(t)/\partial {t}$ (see~Panel~C, Figure~\ref{fig:jmExplanationPlot_1757}). The corresponding parameters are $\alpha_{1p}$ and $\alpha_{2p}$, respectively. Lastly, $h_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard at time $t$, and is modeled flexibly using P-splines \citep{eilers1996flexible}. The detailed specification of the baseline hazard $h_0(t)$, and the joint parameter estimation of the two sub-models using the Bayesian approach (R package \textbf{JMbayes}\cite{rizopoulosJMbayes}) are presented in Appendix A of the supplementary material.
