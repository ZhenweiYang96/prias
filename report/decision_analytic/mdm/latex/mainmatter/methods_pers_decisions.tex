\subsection{Personalized Decisions for Biopsy}
\label{subsec:pers_decision_making}
Let us assume that a decision of conducting a biopsy is to be made for a new patient $j$ shown in Figure~\ref{fig:obsDataPlot_2340}, at his current follow-up visit time $s$. Let $t\leq s$ be the time of his latest negative biopsy. Let $\mathcal{Y}_{dj}(s)$ and $\mathcal{Y}_{pj}(s)$ denote his observed DRE and PSA measurements up to the current visit, respectively. From the observed measurements we want to extract the underlying measurement error free trend of $\log_2 (\mbox{PSA} + 1)$ values and velocity, and the log odds of obtaining $\mbox{DRE} > \mbox{T1c}$. We intend to combine them to inform us when the cancer progression is to be expected (see Figure~\ref{fig:dynRiskPlot_2340}), and to further guide the decision making on whether to conduct a biopsy at the current follow-up visit. The combined information is given by the following posterior predictive distribution $g(T^*_j)$ of his time of cancer progression $T^*_j > t$ (see Appendix~A.4 for details):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:post_pred_dist}
g(T^*_j) = p\big\{T^*_j \mid T^*_j > t, \mathcal{Y}_{dj}(s), \mathcal{Y}_{pj}(s), \mathcal{D}_n\big\}.
\end{equation}
The distribution $g(T^*_j)$ is not only patient-specific, but also updates as extra information is recorded at future follow-up visits.

Biopsy is recommended if the personalized cumulative risk of cancer progression estimated from the joint model fitted to the observed data of the patient, is higher than the example risk threshold for biopsy ($\kappa=$ 15\%). \textbf{Panel~A:} biopsy is not recommended for the patient $j$ at the follow-up visit time $s=4$ years, because his estimated personalized cumulative risk of cancer progression (10.2\%) is less than the threshold. \textbf{Panel~B:} biopsy is recommended for the patient $j$ at the follow-up visit time $s=5.3$ years, because his estimated personalized cumulative risk of cancer progression (17.8\%) is more than the threshold.}

A key ingredient in the decision of conducting a biopsy for patient $j$ at the current follow-up visit time $s$, is the personalized cumulative risk of observing a cancer progression at time $s$ (illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:dynRiskPlot_2340}). This risk can be derived from the posterior predictive distribution $g(T^*_j)$ \cite{rizopoulos2011dynamic}, and is given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dynamic_risk_prob}
R_j(s \mid t) = \mbox{Pr}\big\{T^*_j \leq s \mid T^*_j > t, \mathcal{Y}_{dj}(s), \mathcal{Y}_{pj}(s), \mathcal{D}_n\big\}, \quad s \geq t.
\end{equation}
A simple and straightforward approach to decide upon conducting a biopsy for patient $j$ at the current follow-up visit would be to do so if his personalized cumulative risk of cancer progression at the visit is higher than a certain threshold $0 \leq \kappa \leq 1$. For example, as shown in Panel~B of Figure~\ref{fig:dynRiskPlot_2340}, biopsy at a visit may be scheduled if the personalized cumulative risk is higher than 15\% (example risk threshold). This decision making process is iterated over the follow-up period, incorporating on each subsequent visit the new observed data, until a positive biopsy is observed. Subsequently, an entire personalized schedule of biopsies for each patient can be obtained.

%Ideally, thresholds should be chosen on the basis of their decision theoretic utility for patients. That is, an ideal threshold (see Figure~\ref{fig:better_balance_intro}) will minimize a bivariate function of the number of biopsies and the delay in detection of progression. However, due to the lack of usage of risk based biopsy scheduling, it is not possible to obtain this function from the PRIAS data. Alternatively, a threshold which minimizes only the expected delay is given by, ${\kappa=R_j\{E_g(T^*_j) \mid t\}}$, where $E_g(T^*_j)$ is expected progression time based on (\ref{eq:post_pred_dist}). Since, cancer progression is a slowly progressing disease, the personalized distribution of time of cancer progression $g(T^*_j)$ is only known up to year 10 (maximum follow-up period in PRIAS). Consequently, it is infeasible to compute $E_g(T^*_j)$ without incorrectly extrapolating patient risk profiles beyond year 10.

The choice of the risk threshold dictates the schedule of biopsies. In this regard, a straightforward approach is choosing risk thresholds utilized in standard clinical settings, e.g., 5\% or 10\% risk, at all follow-up visits. The number of biopsies a risk threshold may eventually lead to, is related to its accuracy of classification between patients who progress and non-progressions. The classification accuracy of a risk threshold varies over the follow-up period. This motivates an alternative approach, where at each follow-up visit a threshold with a better classification accuracy is chosen. More specifically, given the time of latest biopsy $t$, and the current visit time $s$ of the new patient $j$, we are interested in a threshold $\kappa$, which gives the highest cancer progression detection rate (true positive rate, or TPR) for the period $(t, s]$. However, maximizing only for TPR may also lead to many unnecessary biopsy suggestions (high false positive rate, or FPR). Subsequently, balancing for the FPR, may further lead to a low number of correct detections (high false negative rate). These issues can be mitigated by maximizing the TPR and positive predictive value (PPV), simultaneously. To this end, we utilize the $\mbox{F}_1$ score, which is a composite of TPR and PPV (estimated as in Rizopoulos~et~al. \cite{landmarking2017}), and is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:F1_TPR_PPV}
\begin{split}
\mbox{F}_1(t,  s, \kappa) &= 2\frac{\mbox{TPR}(t,  s, \kappa)\ \mbox{PPV}(t,  s, \kappa)}{\mbox{TPR}(t,  s, \kappa) + \mbox{PPV}(t,  s, \kappa)},\\
\mbox{TPR}(t,  s, \kappa) &= \mbox{Pr}\big\{R_j(s \mid t) > \kappa \mid t < T^*_j \leq s\big\},\\
\mbox{PPV}(t,  s, \kappa) &= \mbox{Pr}\big\{t < T^*_j \leq s \mid R_j(s \mid t) > \kappa \big\}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The $\mbox{F}_1$ score ranges between 0 and 1, where a value of 1 signifies perfect TPR and PPV. Since a high $\mbox{F}_1$ score is desired, the threshold ${\kappa=\argmax_{\kappa} \mbox{F}_1(t, s, \kappa)}$. 

It is important to note that the suggested $\mbox{F}_1$ score is not the utility of the corresponding personalized biopsy schedule for the patients. The utility on which we evaluate both fixed risk and $\mbox{F}_1$ score based personalized schedules, is still the total number of biopsies scheduled, and the delay in detection of cancer progression (details in \hyperref[sec:results]{Results}).
