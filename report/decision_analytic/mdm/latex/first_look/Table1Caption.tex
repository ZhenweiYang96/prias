\caption{\textbf{Summary statistics for the PRIAS dataset}. The primary event of interest is cancer progression. A DRE measurement equal to T1c\cite{schroder1992tnm} indicates a clinically inapparent tumor which is not palpable or visible by imaging, while tumors with $\mbox{DRE} > \mbox{T1c}$ are palpable. The abbreviation IQR means interquartile range.}
