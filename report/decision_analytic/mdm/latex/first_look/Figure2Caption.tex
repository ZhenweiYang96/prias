\caption{\textbf{Estimated cumulative risk of cancer progression in AS} for patients in the Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS) dataset. Nearly 50\% patients (\textit{slow progressing}) do not progress in the ten year follow-up period. Cumulative risk is estimated using nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation \citep{turnbull1976empirical}, to account for interval censored cancer progression times observed in the PRIAS dataset. Censoring includes death, removal from AS on the basis of observed longitudinal data, and patient dropout.}
