\caption{\textbf{Illustration of personalized decision of biopsy} for patient $j$ at two different follow-up visits. Biopsy is recommended if the personalized cumulative risk of cancer progression estimated from the joint model fitted to the observed data of the patient, is higher than the example risk threshold for biopsy ($\kappa=$ 10\%). \textbf{Panel~A:} biopsy is not recommended for the patient $j$ at the follow-up visit time $s=4$ years, because his estimated personalized cumulative risk of cancer progression (7.8\%) is less than the threshold. \textbf{Panel~B:} biopsy is recommended for the patient $j$ at the follow-up visit time $s=5.3$ years, because his estimated personalized cumulative risk of cancer progression (13.5\%) is more than the threshold.}
