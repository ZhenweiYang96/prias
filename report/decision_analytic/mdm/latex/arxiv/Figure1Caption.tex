\caption{\textbf{The personalized decision making problem:} Available data of a patient $j$, who had his latest negative biopsy at $t=2.6$ years. The shaded region shows the time period in which the patient is at risk of cancer progression. His current pre-scheduled follow-up visit for measurement of DRE and PSA is at $s=4$ years. Using his entire history of DRE $\mathcal{Y}_{dj}(s)$ and PSA $\mathcal{Y}_{pj}(s)$ measurements up to the current visit $s$, and the time of the latest biopsy $t$, we intend to make a decision on scheduling a biopsy at the current visit.}
