\caption{\textbf{Burden-biopsy frontier:} Median number of biopsies (X-axis), and median delay in detection of cancer progression (in years, Y-axis), estimated from the simulation study. Results for currently practiced fixed/heuristic biopsy schedules are shown by red squares, for PRIAS schedule by a blue rhombus, and for personalized schedules by green triangles. \textbf{Types of personalized schedules:} Risk:~15\%, Risk:~10\%, and Risk:~5\% approaches, schedule a biopsy if the cumulative risk of cancer progression at a visit is more than 15\%, 10\%, and 5\%, respectively. Risk:~F1 works similar as previous, except that for each patient, a visit-specific risk threshold is chosen by maximizing $\mbox{F}_1$ score (see \hyperref[sec:methods]{Methods}). The green shaded region depicts the region of better balance in the median number of biopsies and median delay than the currently practiced fixed/heuristic schedules.}
