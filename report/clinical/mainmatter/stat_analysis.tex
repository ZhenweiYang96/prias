\subsection{Statistical Methods}
The goal of the statistical analysis of the PRIAS data was to develop a model for predicting disease reclassification. The PRIAS dataset has certain features which need to be accounted for in the modeling process. For example, the PSA measurements for each patient are more similar/correlated than with other patients. The PSA profiles of patients are also non-linear. While compliance to PSA measurements is high (90\%), PSA measurements of patients who obtain disease reclassification are not available after reclassification. These missing observations if were available were likely going to be higher than the measurements of patients who did not obtain Gleason reclassification.
