\section{Patients and Methods}

\subsection{Study Cohort}
Prostate Cancer International Active Surveillance (PRIAS) is an ongoing prospective cohort study of men with low- and very-low risk PCa diagnoses \cite{bul2013active}. More than 100 medical centers from 17 countries contribute in PRIAS, using a common study protocol (\url{www.prias-project.org}). We used the data collected between December~2006 (beginning of PRIAS study) and May~2019. The PSA was measured every three months until year two of follow-up and every six months thereafter. Biopsy schedule was year one, four, seven, and ten, and additional yearly biopsies when PSA doubling time was between zero and ten years. The primary event used in this work is Gleason~$\geq$~7 (GS7) because it is commonly used as a trigger for treatment advice. It was observed in 1134 patients. However, 2250 patients were provided treatment (see Table \ref{table:prias_summary}). Treatment in absence of GS7 may have been advised on the basis of PSA, number of biopsy cores with cancer, anxiety, or other reasons. We focused only on GS7 because of its strong association with cancer-related outcomes. Due to the periodical nature of biopsies, the time of GS7 was only available as a time interval in which GS7 occurred.
