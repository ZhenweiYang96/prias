\section{Conclusions}
We successfully developed and validated a model for predicting upgrading-risk, and providing risk-based personalized biopsy decisions, in prostate cancer AS. The model made available via a user-friendly web-application (\url{https://emcbiostatistics.shinyapps.io/prias_biopsy_recommender/}) enables shared decision making of biopsy schedules by comparing fixed and personalized schedules on total biopsies and expected time delay in detecting upgrading. Novel biomarkers and MRI data can be added as predictors in the model to improve predictions in the future. Recalibration of baseline upgrading-risk is advised for external cohorts.
