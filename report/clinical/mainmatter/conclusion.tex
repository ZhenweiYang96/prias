\section{Conclusions}
We developed a novel methodology for personalized scheduling of biopsies, to detect reclassification (increase in Gleason grade from grade~1 to 2 or higher) in active surveillance prostate cancer patients. Personalized schedules utilize personalized risk of reclassification. Our model predicts this risk using a patient's whole history of PSA, repeat biopsy results and baseline characteristics. Our methodology is time-dynamic because it updates the personalized schedules as more patient data is gathered over follow-up. To assist patients and doctors in making the choice of a suitable biopsy schedule, we provide them estimates of personalized burden (time and total biopsies), and personalized benefit (time delay in detection of reclassification; lesser is beneficial), for both personalized and currently used schedules. Our methodology is available for use in practice at \url{https://emcbiostatistics.shinyapps.io/prias_biopsy_recommender/}.
