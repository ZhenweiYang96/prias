\section{Conclusions}
We developed a novel methodology and model for personalized scheduling of biopsies in prostate cancer active surveillance (AS) patients. Personalized schedules utilize a patient's risk of reclassification to decide biopsies. They are a promising alternative to fixed and frequent biopsy schedules. We have made them available in a web-application \url{https://emcbiostatistics.shinyapps.io/prias_biopsy_recommender/} for world's six largest AS cohorts. The web-application also assists patients and doctors in choosing a suitable schedule. This is because, it provides them estimates of personalized burden (time and total biopsies), and personalized benefit (time delay in detection of reclassification; lesser is beneficial), for both personalized and currently used schedules.
