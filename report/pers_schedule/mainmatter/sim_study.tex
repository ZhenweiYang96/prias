\section{Simulation study}
\label{sec: simulation_study}
For contrasting the personalized scheduling approaches against the schedule of PRIAS and the schedule of doing biopsy every year, we performed a simulation study. We used the parameters from the joint model fitted to the original PRIAS data set to generate 60 data sets with 1000 patients each. We employed a Weibull baseline hazard while generating Gleason reclassification times for the simulated patients. We divided the 60 data sets into groups of 10 each, and within each group the parameter values for the Weibull baseline hazard were kept the same, while across the group they were different. The reason to create such groups was to ensure the consistency of results within in each group. Using different parameter values for the baseline hazard across the groups ensured that we tested not only the scenarios in which patients have early progression times but also those in which patients have late progression times. This is important because how late/early patients are observed to have Gleason reclassification, partially depends on the induction criteria of the AS program.

\subsection{Simulation setup}
\label{subsec : simulation_setup}
We divided each of the 60 data sets into training (750 patients) and test (250 patients) parts. We fitted a joint model to the training data set and using it we generated biopsy schedules for patients in the test data set.

\subsubsubsection{Evaluating performance of personalized biopsy schedules}

Since we generate the true Gleason reclassification time for each of the patients in the test data set, we are able to calculate the offset for each patient and each scheduling method. While creating the personalized schedules we adhere to the PSA measurement schedule of PRIAS. 

\subsection{Results}
Since the Gleason reclassification times varied widely across the simulation data sets, we discuss the results separately for the different scenarios. In total we have 6 scenarios corresponding to the 6 groups of 10 data sets. For brevity, we only chose 3 most dissimilar scenarios and further we present one set of results for each of the 3 scenarios. The complete set of results can be found at \url{https://goo.gl/u6dg8G}. At this moment, we will not compare our results against the PRIAS schedule, since the PRIAS schedule we used is fixed for all patients, whereas in reality it can be dynamic if the PSA doubling time is less than 10 years.

\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
In the first scenario the Gleason reclassification times for the patients are mostly between 7 and 11 years. The Gleason reclassification times of test patients from one of the data sets is shown in Figure \ref{fig : sc_10_sh_7pt5_progression_hist}. Figure \ref{fig : sc_10_sh_7pt5_offset_boxplot} shows that, for this data set the approaches with the least number of biopsies, 2 in number, are conditional expected failure time, and dynamic risk with a threshold $\kappa$ chosen such that accuracy (section \ref{subsubsec : dynamic_risk_definitions}) is maximized. The mean and median offset for the two approaches is around 9 months. However for a few outlying patients the offset is more than 24 months. If we compare this to the schedule of performing biopsy every year the mean offset is around 6 months and mean number of biopsies is 8.

\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
Unlike the previous scenario, the Gleason reclassification times for the patients in Scenario 2 are mostly between 0 and 5 years. The Gleason reclassification times of test patients from one of the data sets is shown in Figure \ref{fig : sc_6_sh_1pt5_progression_hist}. Figure \ref{fig : sc_6_sh_1pt5_offset_boxplot} shows that, for this data set the approach with the least number of biopsies is conditional expected failure time. The mean and median number of biopsies are 1.5 and 1 respectively. While the mean and median offset is around 18 months, there is considerable variation in the offset for the various patients. The first and third quartiles are at 12 months and 27 months respectively. The large variation in offset is due to the fact that time to Gleason reclassification has larger variance since it is based on a small history of the patient. In such a scenario one might be inclined towards doing a biopsy every year as they have the least offset. However that approach leads to a very large number of biopsies as shown in Figure \ref{fig : sc_6_sh_1pt5_nb_boxplot}. Certain approaches based on dynamic risk perform better here, both in terms of number of biopsies as well as the offset. In particular if the choice of $\kappa$ can be based on maximization of the Youden index or a fixed $\kappa$ can be chosen.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Scenario 3}
In scenario 3, the Gleason reclassification times for the patients are widely spread, mostly between 2 and 9 years. i.e. patients fail late as well early. The Gleason reclassification times of test patients from one of the data sets is shown in Figure \ref{fig : sc_8pt5_sh_3_progression_hist}. Figure \ref{fig : sc_8pt5_sh_3_offset_boxplot} shows that, for this data set the approach with the least number of biopsies is conditional expected failure time. The mean and median number of biopsies are 1.5 and 1 respectively. This method also has considerable variation in the offset for the various patients. The first and third quartiles are at 9 months and 27 months respectively. A more detailed analysis revealed that the variation in offset was higher for subjects with earlier failure times. For e.g. the mean and median offset in subjects with reclassification times more than 4 years was nearly 13.5 months. For others it was nearly 39.5 months. This is once again is due to the fact that time to Gleason reclassification has larger variance since it is based on a small history of the patient. And thus usefulness of conditional expected failure time is questionable.\\

Dynamic risk based methods once again provide an alternative. If a fixed $\kappa$ of 0.15 is used then although the offset will be low, there is very high variation in number of biopsies. i.e. people who have reclassifications early will benefit but people who have reclassifications later will have too many biopsies. If $\kappa$ is chosen such that accuracy is maximized, and a biopsy is done whenever there is a gap of 2 years then a reasonable offset is obtained. The first and third quartiles are almost 4.5 and 18 months. The first and third quartiles for number of biopsies are 3 and 4.

\subsection{A mixed approach: E(T) vs dynamic risk}
While we did create biopsy schedules using conditional expected Gleason reclassification time, and dynamic risk of Gleason reclassification based approaches, we saw that no single approach works best in all scenarios. In particular, we observed that when the failure times are early dynamic risk based approaches perform better in terms of offset than conditional expected Gleason reclassification time. The latter works best when the Gleason reclassification times are later. This has motivated us to use a mixed approach, where we schedule biopsies using dynamic risk based approaches if the variance (Eq. \ref{eq : varFailureTime}) of time to Gleason reclassification is higher than a certain threshold, otherwise we use conditional expected Gleason reclassification time. This is still work in progress.
