In this paper we presented personalized biopsy scheduling methods for patients enrolled in AS programs. We presented 2 different class of personalized scheduling methods: one based on expected time of GR of a patient and the others based on risk of GR of a patient. Contrary to the scheduling methods which are used in practice such as PRIAS schedule and annual biopsy schedule, personalized methods have an advantage that they are tailored for the needs of individual patients. Furthermore, these methods combine information from previous repeat biopsies as well PSA measurements. In particular, we found that PSA velocity was useful in predicting risk of GR and thus also useful in creating personalized schedules.
