\section{Choosing a Schedule}
\label{sec : choosing_schedule}
Given a particular schedule $S$ of biopsies, our next goal is to evaluate the efficacy of this schedule and to compare it with other schedules. To this end, we first present the criteria for evaluation of efficacy of biopsy schedules and then discuss the choice of the optimal schedule.

\subsection{Evaluation of Efficacy of Schedules}
We measure the efficacy of a schedule $S$ using two criteria, namely, for the $j$-th patient the number of biopsies $N^{bS}_j \epsilon [1, \infty]$ a schedule conducts before GR is detected, and the offset $O^S_j \epsilon [0, \infty]$ by which it overshoots the true GR time $T^*_j$. The offset $O^S_j$ is defined as $O^S_j = T^S_{j{N^{bS}_j}} - T^*_j$, where $T^S_{j{N^{bS}_j}} \geq T^*_j$ is the time at which GR is detected. Our interest lies in the joint distribution $p(N^{bS}_j, O^S_j)$ of the number of biopsies and the offset. Given the medical and financial burden associated with biopsies, ideally only one biopsy which leads to a zero offset should be conducted. That is, a method with a low mean number of biopsies $E(N^{bS}_j)$ as well a low mean offset $E(O^S_j)$ is desired. It is also desired that a method has low variance of the number of biopsies $\mbox{var}(N^{bS}_j)$, as well as low variance of the offset $\mbox{var}(O^S_j)$, so that the method works similarly for most patients. Quantiles of $p(N^{bS}_j)$ may also be of interest. For example, a schedule which conducts less than two biopsies in 95\% of the cases may be preferred.

\subsection{Finding the Optimal Schedule}
Given the multiple measures of efficacy of a schedule, the next step is to find the optimal schedule. Using principles from compound optimal designs \citep{lauter1976optimal} we propose to choose a schedule $S$ which minimizes a loss function of the following form:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq : loss_func_sim_study_generic}
L(S) = \sum_{r=1}^R \eta_r \mathcal{R}_r(N^{bS}_j).
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{R}_r(\cdot)$ is a measure of efficacy of either the number of biopsies or the offset (in the equation above, only $N^{bS}_j$ is used for brevity of notation). Some examples of $\mathcal{R}_r(\cdot)$ are mean, median, variance and quantile function. Constants $\eta_1, \ldots, \eta_R$, where $\eta_r \epsilon [0,1]$ and $\sum_{r=1}^R \eta_r = 1$, are weights to differentially weigh-in the contribution of each of the $R$ measures of efficacy. An example loss function is:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq : loss_func_sim_study}
L(S) = \eta_1 E(N^{bS}_j) + \eta_2 E(O^S_j). 
\end{equation}
The choice of $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$ is not easy, because biopsies have serious medical side effects and consequently the cost of an extra biopsy cannot be quantified or compared to a unit increase in offset easily. To obviate this problem we utilize the equivalence between compound and constrained optimal designs \citep{cook1994equivalence}. More specifically, it can be shown that for any $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$ there exists a constant $C>0$ for which minimization of loss function in (\ref{eq : loss_func_sim_study}) is equivalent to minimization of the loss function subject to the constraint that $E(O^S_j) < C$. That is, the optimal schedule is the one with the least number of biopsies and an offset less than $C$. The choice of $C$ now can be based on the protocol of AS program. In the more generic case in (\ref{eq : loss_func_sim_study_generic}), the optimal solution can be found by minimizing $\mathcal{R}_R(\cdot)$ under the constraint $\mathcal{R}_r(\cdot) < C_r; r=1, \ldots, R-1$.
