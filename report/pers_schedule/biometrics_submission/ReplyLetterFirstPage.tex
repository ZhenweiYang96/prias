\opening{Dear Professor Daniels,}

We are writing to you with respect to the manuscript \#BIOM2017609M, titled ``Personalized schedules for surveillance of low risk prostate cancer patients''  submitted to \emph{Biometrics} and the reports we received after its review. We would like to thank you for giving us the opportunity to submit a revised version of our paper that tackles the weaknesses of the previous version.

Following the recommendations from the Reviewers, we have made several changes in the revised version of the manuscript. In particular, we have invested more in the new version in .... To this end .... The previous version was 25 pages long and you have asked us to reduce that to ... pages (including title, authorship, abstract, body of manuscript, acknowledgments, references). While according to the suggestions of the Reviewers we have included new pieces of information, we have managed to reduce the length of the paper to 21.5 pages. We hope that this is acceptable.

Please find enclosed a detailed point-by-point response to the Reviewers' comments.\\

Yours sincerely,

the Authors
